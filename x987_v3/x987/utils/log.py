"""Very small logging helpers used by the pipeline.

The real project uses a richer logging framework but for the purposes of the
exercise we just need a couple of convenience functions.  ``info`` retains its
original behaviour while ``step`` and ``ok`` provide lightâ€‘weight wrappers so
other modules can signal progress without pulling in additional dependencies.
